Overview
========

In this folder you'll find "pqos.i" a SWIG interface file
that allow libpqos usage in scripting languages (e.g. in Perl).
Currently the full API is exported but only CAT and CMT (LLC occupancy) related
parts were tested.


Requirements, compilation and installation
==========================================

Requires SWIG and Perl (-devel).
Tested Linux running SWIG Version 3.0.5 and Perl v5.18.4
and FreeBSD running SWIG Version 3.0.8 and Perl v5.14.2

To compile lipqos interface file:
        "perl Makefile.PL" to generate Makefile.
        "make" to build SWIG Perl interface (Perl module and shared lib).
        "make clean" for cleaning.
        "sudo make test" to test.
        "sudo make install" to install SWIG Perl interface.


Usage
=====

Add "use pqos;" to your Perl script.

Note:
        In case of error while running "sudo make install" such as:
        "touch: cannot touch ‘pqos.bs’: Permission denied
        Makefile:442: recipe for target 'pqos.bs' failed
        make: *** [pqos.bs] Error 1"
        please rerun make

        In case of error while running script such as:
        "Can't locate pqos.pm in @INC ..."
        or
        "Can't locate loadable object for module pqos in @INC"
        make sure that you have installed SWIG Perl interface,
        if not, just run "sudo make install"
